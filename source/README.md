# TasksApp: Deploying a PHP and MySQL app in Azure App Service

Azure App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service using the Linux operating system. In this project, I have explored two Azure Services: **Azure App Service** and **Azure Database for MySQL Server**. I have deployed a basic PHP Laravel App in Azure and connected it to a MySQL Database in Azure. I have used Local Git as the deployment source. The app is a basic Tasks App(a To-Do list app) that can be used to add, delete and display tasks persistently.
